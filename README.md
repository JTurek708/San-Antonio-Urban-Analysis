# San Antonio Urban Analysis

San Antonio, TX is the 7th largest city in the United States and often billed as one of the fastest growing cities in Texas and the country. With a rapidly growing population, San Antonio is under pressure to provide adequate services to new residents while also improving services to existing residents, especially those in poor areas of the city. San Antonio has the highest poverty rate of all large US metros, as well.

This project will sort of serve as a catch-all for different urban-related analyses I plan to conduct. Some topics that I have in mind (not all inclusive) are:

    Population density changes
    Construction permits pulled/approved
    Public health indicators
    Transit quality
    Walkability
    Urban tree canopy
    Census analyses
    Voting / elections

I plan to either store data I use either here in GitHub or in Google Cloud. Once I figure that out, I'll post a link where you can access the data and run your own analyses.

If anyone is interested in collaborating on a specific project, drop me a toot over at Mastodon - @jackturek708@urbanists.social
