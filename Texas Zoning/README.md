# Zoning in Texas Project
The goal of this project is to determine how major Texas cities are zoned and in what % - single family zoning, mixed use, multi-family, commercial, etc
To start I'll be looking at the Texas cities of Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio.
I also plan to look at how median rents, median home sale price, and other urban indicators have changed over the last two decades and attempt to see how zoning practices in these cities have affected these indicators

## San Antonio, Texas
- Permits issued & COSA Zoning data will be hosted elsewhere due to large file size. Will post link when available.

## Austin, Texas
- Residential permits issued data too large for GH, will be hosted elsewhere. Will post link when available.
